## Preparation Strategy

1. MERN Stack (4hours - 2pm to 6pm) + DSA (4hours - 6pm to 7pm and 9pm to 12am) + System Design (4hours - 12am to 4am) => 12 hours/day
2. Expected Deadline is 10days i.e. revise everything by 15th May => Then apply aggressively


## Technologies 
1. Frameworks (Next, Express, Laravel, Flask)
2. Programming Langugaes (Javascript, Typescript, Java, Python, Go, C#, Rust, Ruby, PHP)
3. Database (Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora), NonRelational (MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase))
4. Caching (CDN, BrowserCache, Redis, Memcache)
5. Testing (Unit testing, Integration Testing, Functional Testing)
6. VCS (Github, Gitlab, BitBucket)
7. CI/CD (Github Actions, CircleCI, ArgoCD)
8. API (REST, GraphQL, tRPC)
9. Architectural Pattern (Microservice, Monolithic, Serverless)
10. Containerization (Docker, Container, LXC)

## Cloud Native Architecture

There are 2 main focus - Availability and Scalability
There are 4 pillars to cloud native 
1. DevOps
2. Cloud Native Open Standards
3. Containers
4. Microservies

Frontend - *React, Vue, Angular
Backend - Flask, Django, Ruby, *Node, Golang
Database - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB


Javascript/Java/Python
Javascript (React,Angular,Vue + Node,Express)
Java (Spring Boot)
Python (Django)

Database (SQL and NoSQL databases)
Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
CI/CD (github actions)

My goal is the go all in. I want to target best of the companies with best of the package.
Target : 100K dollars
