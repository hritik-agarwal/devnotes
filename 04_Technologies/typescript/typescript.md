## Introduction

- It is javascript with syntax for types which allows for lot of error handling during compilation time only.
- It is converted to js and can be run anywhere where js can run.
- Some TypeScript Commands

  ```js
  // compile ts to js
  tsc main.ts
  // compile ts to js along with live re-compilation
  tsc main.ts -w
  // initialize ts
  tsc --init
  // live re-compilation
  tsc -w
  ```

## Basic Types

- TS is a strongly typed language and have static type checking i.e. it requires type specifications and those are checked at compile time.
- JS is a weakly typed language and have dynamic type checking i.e. it doesn't requires type specifications and those are checked at run time.
