## How JAVA works?

0. Install JDK to write code.
1. Programmers write the java code.
2. Java code is then converted to byte code using a compiler (javac).
3. The byte code is then passed to java virtual machine (jvm) to run the code.
4. JVM is inside a java virtual environment (jre) which contains libraries needed to run the code.
5. The JRE and JVM are platform dependent but the java code is platform independent i.e. write once run anywhere (wora).
