# MERN Stack

## What is MERN Stack?

A combination of technologies used to develop web applications.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing large amounts of data in a flexible and scalable way.
- **Express**: A back-end framework for Node.js for building APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript platform for building fast and scalable applications.

## Pre-requisites for MERN Stack

Before diving into the MERN stack, it is important to have a strong foundation in certain programming concepts and technologies.

#### HTML and CSS

1. Understanding of HTML tags, attributes, and elements
2. Knowledge of basic CSS for styling web pages

#### JavaScript

3. Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await
4. Modules and Require
5. ES6 Features such as Arrow functions, Classes, Template Literals, and Spread Operator
6. HTTP Requests and APIs
7. Error Handling
8. Familiarity with JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as Express and React

## Tools required for MERN Stack

- Chrome Browser
- VSCode
- NodeJS
- Postman
- MongoDB
- Git/Github

## Planning a MERN Stack Project

#### Project Requirements

E.g. A crypto centric blog app that shows latest news and related stuff in crypto.

1. Functional Requirements
   1. user authentication
   2. blog creation and management
   3. blog commenting
   4. cryptocurrency data integration
2. Non-functional Requirements
   1. user experience
   2. performance
   3. scalability
   4. security

#### Website Designing

- Create a wirefame using Excalidraw
- Create a website template using Figma
- Designing the database schema

## Building a MERN app

- Frontend
- Backend
  - install packages :-
    | express       | handle web server                   |
    |---------------|-------------------------------------|
    | mongoose      | handle mongodb                      |
    | dotenv        | handle environment variables        |
    | cors          | handle CORS error                   |
    | joi           | handle data validation              |
    | bcryptjs      | handle password hashing             |
    | jwt           | handle authentication/authorization |
    | cookie-parser | handle jwt storage |
  - setup express (create app)
  - setup mongodb (connection and schema)
  - setup routes (create routes and controllers)
  - setup user login/register
